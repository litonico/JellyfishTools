Jellyfish Tools
===============

A set of command-line tools to create and display hyperbolic geometry. Its goal is to provide an easy way to model organic structures in a way that can be manipulated and used in computer graphics. 

Where does this come from?
-------------------------

This is based on the work of Diana Taimina, who developed a method of crocheting models of the hyperbolic plane to demonstrate its properties.  


To Do
-----
+ Implement bending stiffness between triangles of the mesh (in progress)
+ Refactor OpenGL parameters and camera controls into a separate file
+ Implement support for fixed points (pins), and include gravity into the Verlet integration routine
