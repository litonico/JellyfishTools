Jellyfish Tools
===============
![Jellyfish Tools Example](http://i.imgur.com/xK9U9Q9.png)

A set of command-line tools to create and display hyperbolic geometry. Its goal is to provide an easy way to model organic structures in a way that can be manipulated and used in computer graphics. 

What does it do?
----------------

+ Generates a set of points and a set of edges

Runs, in Open Gl:
+ Spring simulation on the edges (cell walls)
+ Verlet momentum simulation on the points (cells)
+ Bending stiffness

Where does this come from?
--------------------------

This is based on the work of Diana Taimina, who developed a method of crocheting models of the hyperbolic plane to demonstrate its properties.
